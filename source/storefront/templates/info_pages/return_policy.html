                <p>IMPORTANT: Due to the developing COVID-19 situation we cannot accept returns of any food items.
                    This limitation supersedes all other shipping and return policies weâ€™ve previously had until further notice.</p>
                <p>Our products come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee promise. If you are not satisfied in any way
                    by your purchase, please let us know and we will work with you to make things right.</p>
                <p>If you decide not to use the products you purchased, it is often possible to return them to us for
                    a refund. This is considered on a case-by-case and is fully at the discretion of our management.
                    If we accept a full return, then a full refund of the purchase price, excluding shipping costs,
                    both for delivery and return of the merchandise, where applicable, will be issued upon receiving
                    the merchandise in the same condition in which it was shipped, provided that it is before its
                    expiration date. In some cases we may be able to refund the shipping costs as well.</p>
