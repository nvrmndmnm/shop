                <p>Shipping costs may differ depending on your delivery address. There is a shipping calculator at
                    the checkout page, please use it if you want to check the exact shipping costs for your order.</p>
                <p>We ship all orders within five days of receiving the order, often on the very same day.</p>
                <p>We use a variety of carriers for our shipments. You may have the option to select a preferred one
                    at checkout. However, we may end up using a different carrier than the one you have selected if the
                    carrier your selected is not available or applicable for delivery to your address. If for some
                    reason we cannot accommodate your choice of shipping carrier, we do reserve the right to use a
                    different carrier than the one you selected, with the same or better delivery service and same
                    or lower cost to you.</p>
                <p>Shipping costs may differ depending on your delivery address. There is a shipping calculator at the
                    checkout page, please use it if you want to check the exact shipping costs for your order. These
                    costs may change based on your location and the nature of your order. Depending on your location,
                    it is possible that your order may incur additional delivery costs like duties, excise or import
                    fees imposed by your customs office.</p>

                <h2 class="my-4">When To Expect Your Order</h2>
                <p>Once we receive the order, we process it within hours. Provided that all items from your order
                    are in stock, we (or your local distributor) will ship the order within 1 to 5 days, often on the
                    very same day. Please note that it is possible that some locations we ship from may have restrictions
                    â€” for example shipping Monday to Wednesday only.</p>
                <p>Once your order is processed and shipped, you will receive an email confirming the shipment,
                    including a tracking number if available and if you opted for one at checkout.</p>
                <p>Your order status is available at any time in your Order History page in your online account with us.</p>

                <h2 class="my-4">Delivery</h2>
                <p>FP-Mart is able to ship orders anywhere in the world. Of course, there might be some restrictions
                    shipping to some destinations.</p>
                <p>If your order is shipped to a destination outside the EU or EEA, the recipient may be charged
                    duties and taxes upon delivery of the order.  Duties and taxes are determined by the authorities
                    in the country to which the order is being shipped to. We have no control or prior knowledge of
                    these fees. Please contact your customs office for further inquiries.</p>
                <p>All non-EU destinations should expect their order to go through customs and be required to pay
                    import duties and or fees. Since Brexit, this is also the case for all orders from the UK.</p>
                <p>By placing such an order you are agreeing to pay any duties and taxes that may be applicable upon
                    import into your country. By placing you order with us you agree that you have read and are fully
                    aware of all additional delivery charges that you may incur because of your shipping destination.</p>
